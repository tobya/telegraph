In order to receive Telegram updates through a webhook, it has to be registered to a specific bot. This can be accomplished both programmatically and through an artisan command

### artisan command

You can register a webhook calling the `telegraph:set-webhook` artisan command:

```shell
php artisan telegraph:set-webhook
```

some options are available in order to customize the webhook settings, refer to [bots documentation](models/telegraph-bot#registerWebhook) for more info:

```shell
php artisan telegraph:set-webhook --drop-pending-updates --max-connections=100 --secret=super_secret_token
```

### programmatically

if you are implementing a custom bot management logic, you can register a webhok using the `TelegraphBot` model:

```php
/** @var DefStudio\Telegraph\Models\TelegraphBot $telegraphBot */

$telegraphBot->registerWebhook()->send();
```

some options are available in order to customize the webhook settings, refer to [bots documentation](models/telegraph-bot#registerWebhook) for more info:

> [!WARNING]
> Manual updates polling is not available if a webhook is set up for the bot. Webhook should be remove first using its [unregisterWebhook](webhooks/deleting-webhooks) method


## Routes

Telegraph register a route to handle webhook messages. By default, the URL is: `https://<server_domain>/telegraph/{token}/webhook`, but it can be customized in [telegraph.php config](installation#Configuration) file (`webhook.url`) or entirely disabled (by setting its value to `null`)

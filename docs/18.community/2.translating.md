title: 'Translating'
---

Telegraph interacts with Telegram users is multiple ways, in order to offer a better user experience, it's responses can be localized in the user's language:

```php
//in webhook

App::setLocale($this->message->from()->languageCode());

$this->reply(__('Hello')); // Ciao!

```

Anyone can contribute to the supported languages by creating a folder in `resources/lang`, named after the translated language code and adding his own translation files (better if taken from the `resources/lang/en` folder)
